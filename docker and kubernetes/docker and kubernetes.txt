docker Commands (note all commands are uncap, it keeps getting autocorrected to cap) 

run: execute whatever “docker run ngnix”. If not there then it’ll go out and get it.

rm: remove container “docker rm “name of container” 
Images: see what images and sizes of those images “docker images” *don’t remove images if they are being used *you must stop and delete containers that use the image before deleting the image
