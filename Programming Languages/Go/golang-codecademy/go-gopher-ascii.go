/*
i'm completing the ascii challenge by doing the gopher, 
there might be a way to create it easier but at the moment i do not know of one. 
i will keep this as a benchmark for a later project when i learn a bit more.
i added time for the time being "ha" so lateron when i can figure out how to a create a timer for how long it took for the computer to compile
according to the doc found in command go doc time.timer there is a way but i still don't know enough to make something.
